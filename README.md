 🏧 ATM Project (Python)

This is a simple **ATM Simulation Project** developed using **Python**.  
It demonstrates key programming concepts such as **exception handling (both predefined and user-defined)**, **loops**, and **conditional statements** to handle various banking operations effectively.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The **ATM Project** is designed to simulate real-life ATM operations.  
Users can deposit money, withdraw funds, and check their account balance.  
The project mainly focuses on the use of **exception handling** to manage invalid inputs and errors in a clean and controlled way.

## 🚀 Features
- 💳 Simulated user interaction (ATM interface)  
- 💰 Deposit and withdrawal operations  
- 📊 Balance inquiry  
- ⚠️ Handles predefined exceptions such as `ValueError`  
- 🧩 Uses **programmer-defined exceptions** for custom error handling  
- 🔁 Continuous loop until the user chooses to exit
